# Biomarkers of interest
# ======================
#
# This script tries to find interesting biomarkers based on the differential
# expression results. Phosphosites of interest are defined as follows:
'''
Efficacy-predictive biomarkers:
===============================
 * Downregulated by the drug in responders while non- or up-regulated in
   the non-responders. At the same time, they are higher pre-treatment in
   responders compared to non-responders.
   {}

 * Upregulated by the drug in responders while non- or down-regulated in
   the non-responders. At the same time, they are lower pre-treatment in
   responders compared to non-responders.
   {}

Excluder biomarkers:
====================
 * Downregulated by the drug in non-responders while non- or up-regulated
   in the responders. At the same time, they are lower pre-treatment in
   responders compared to non-responders (i.e. higher in non-responders).
   {}

 * Upregulated by the drug in non-responders while non- or down-regulated
   in the responders. At the same time, they are higher pre-treatment in
   responders compared to non-responders (i.e. lower in non-responders).
