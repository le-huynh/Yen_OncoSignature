# OncoSignature - Drug response prediction on Acute Myeloid Leukemia

This repository contains the scripts used to analyze and extract
phosphorilation signatures of drug response in AML samples.

Preliminary analyses were performed on 4 patient samples and 4 cell-lines.
The final data set consisted of 44 patient samples cultivated ex-vivo (for
training) followed by another 22 used for validation.
